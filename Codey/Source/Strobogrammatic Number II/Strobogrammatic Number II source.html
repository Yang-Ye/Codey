<p>A strobogrammatic number is a number that looks the same when rotated 180 degrees (looked at upside down).</p>
<p>Find all strobogrammatic numbers that are of length = n.</p>
<p>For example,<br />Given n = 2, return&nbsp;<code>["11","69","88","96"]</code>.</p>
<p>Hint:</p>
<ol>
<li class="hint animated fadeInLeft">Try to use recursion and notice that it should recurse with&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;- 2 instead of&nbsp;<em>n</em>&nbsp;- 1.</li>
