<p>Given a binary tree, find the length of the longest consecutive sequence path.</p>
<p>The path refers to any sequence of nodes from some starting node to any node in the tree along the parent-child connections. The longest consecutive path need to be from parent to child (cannot be the reverse).</p>
<p>For example,</p>
<pre>   1
    \
     3
    / \
   2   4
        \
         5
</pre>
<p>Longest consecutive sequence path is&nbsp;<code>3-4-5</code>, so return&nbsp;<code>3</code>.</p>
<pre>   2
    \
     3
    / 
   2    
  / 
 1
</pre>
<p>Longest consecutive sequence path is&nbsp;<code>2-3</code>, not<code>3-2-1</code>, so return&nbsp;<code>2</code>.</p>
