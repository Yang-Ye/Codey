<p><p>Given a non negative integer number <b>num</b>. For every numbers <b>i</b> in the range <b>0 &le; i &le; num</b> calculate the number of 1's in their binary representation and return them as an array.
</p>
<p>
<b>Example:</b></br>
For <code>num = 5</code> you should return <code>[0,1,1,2,1,2]</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Follow up:</b>
<ul>
<li>It is very easy to come up with a solution with run time <b>O(n*sizeof(integer))</b>. But can you do it in linear time <b>O(n)</b> /possibly in a single pass?</li>
<li>Space complexity should be <b>O(n)</b>.</li>
<li>Can you do it like a boss? Do it without using any builtin function like <b>__builtin_popcount</b>  in c++ or in any other language.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<ol id="hints">
  <li class="hint">You should make use of what you have produced already.</li>
  <li class="hint">Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.</li>
  <li class="hint">Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?</li>
</ol>
