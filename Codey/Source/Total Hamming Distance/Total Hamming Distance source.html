<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance" target="_blank">Hamming distance</a>&nbsp;between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.</p>
<p>Now your job is to find the total Hamming distance between all pairs of the given numbers.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>Input: 4, 14, 2

Output: 6

Explanation: In binary representation, the 4 is 0100, 14 is 1110, and 2 is 0010 (just
showing the four bits relevant in this case). So the answer will be:
HammingDistance(4, 14) + HammingDistance(4, 2) + HammingDistance(14, 2) = 2 + 2 + 2 = 6.

<li>Elements of the given array are in the range of&nbsp;<code>0&nbsp;</code>to&nbsp;<code>10^9</code></li>
<li>Length of the array will not exceed&nbsp;<code>10^4</code>.</li>
