<p>Given a <strong>non-empty</strong> string, encode the string such that its encoded length is the shortest.</p>
<p>The encoding rule is: <code>k[encoded_string]</code>, where the <em>encoded_string</em> inside the square brackets is being repeated exactly <em>k</em> times.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong><br />
</p>
<ol>
<li><em>k</em> will be a positive integer and encoded string will not be empty or have extra space.</li>
<li>You may assume that the input string contains only lowercase English letters. The string's length is at most 160.</li>
<li>If an encoding process does not make the string shorter, then do not
 encode it. If there are several solutions, return any of them is fine.</li>



</ol>
<p><strong>Example 1:</strong>
</p>
<pre>Input: "aaa"
Output: "aaa"
Explanation: There is no way to encode it such that it is shorter than the input string, so we do not encode it.
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre>Input: "aaaaa"
Output: "5[a]"
Explanation: "5[a]" is shorter than "aaaaa" by 1 character.
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre>Input: "aaaaaaaaaa"
Output: "10[a]"
Explanation: "a9[a]" or "9[a]a" are also valid solutions, both of them have the same length = 5, which is the same as "10[a]".
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 4:</strong></p>
<pre>Input: "aabcaabcd"
Output: "2[aabc]d"
Explanation: "aabc" occurs twice, so one answer can be "2[aabc]d".
</pre>
<p><strong>Example 5:</strong></p>
<pre>Input: "abbbabbbcabbbabbbc"
Output: "2[2[abbb]c]"
Explanation: "abbbabbbc" occurs twice, but "abbbabbbc" can also be encoded to "2[abbb]c", so one answer can be "2[2[abbb]c]".
