Write a function to delete a node (except the tail) in a singly linked list, given only access to that node.
</p>

<p>
Supposed the linked list is <code>1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4</code> and you are given the third node with value <code>3</code>, the linked list should become <code>1 -> 2 -> 4</code> after calling your function.
