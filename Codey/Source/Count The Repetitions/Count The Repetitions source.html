<p>Define&nbsp;<code>S = [s,n]</code>&nbsp;as the string S which consists of n connected strings s. For example,&nbsp;<code>["abc", 3]</code>&nbsp;="abcabcabc".</p>
<p>On the other hand, we define that string s1 can be obtained from string s2 if we can remove some characters from s2 such that it becomes s1. For example, &ldquo;abc&rdquo; can be obtained from &ldquo;abdbec&rdquo; based on our definition, but it can not be obtained from &ldquo;acbbe&rdquo;.</p>
<p>You are given two non-empty strings s1 and s2 (each at most 100 characters long) and two integers 0 &le; n1 &le; 106and 1 &le; n2 &le; 106. Now consider the strings S1 and S2, where&nbsp;<code>S1=[s1,n1]</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>S2=[s2,n2]</code>. Find the maximum integer M such that&nbsp;<code>[S2,M]</code>&nbsp;can be obtained from&nbsp;<code>S1</code>.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre>Input:
s1="acb", n1=4
s2="ab", n2=2

Return:
2</pre>
