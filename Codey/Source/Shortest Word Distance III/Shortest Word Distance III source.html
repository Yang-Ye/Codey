<p>This is a follow-up problem of <a href="http://www.programcreek.com/2014/08/leetcode-shortest-word-distance-java/">Shortest Word Distance</a>. The only difference is now word1 could be the same as word2.</p>
<p>Given a list of words and two words word1 and word2, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.</p>
<p>word1 and word2 may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.</p>
<p>For example,<br/>
Assume that words = ["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"].</p>
<p>Given word1 = “makes”, word2 = “coding”, return 1.<br/>
Given word1 = "makes", word2 = "makes", return 3.</p>
