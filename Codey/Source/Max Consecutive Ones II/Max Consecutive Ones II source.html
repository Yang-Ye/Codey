<p>Given a binary array, find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in this array if you can flip at most one 0.</p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<pre>Input: [1,0,1,1,0]
Output: 4
Explanation: Flip the first zero will get the the maximum number of consecutive 1s.
    After flipping, the maximum number of consecutive 1s is 4.
</pre>

<p>Note:</p>
<ul>
<li>The input array will only contain&nbsp;<code>0</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>1</code>.</li>
<li>The length of input array is a positive integer and will not exceed 10,000</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow up:<br />What if the input numbers come in one by one as an&nbsp;infinite stream? In other words, you can't store all numbers coming from the stream as it's too large to hold in memory. Could you solve it efficiently?</p>
