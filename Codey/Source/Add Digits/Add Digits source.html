<p><p>
Given a non-negative integer <code>num</code>, repeatedly add all its digits until the result has only one digit. 
</p>

<p>
For example:
</p>
<p>
Given <code>num = 38</code>, the process is like: <code>3 + 8 = 11</code>, <code>1 + 1 = 2</code>. Since <code>2</code> has only one digit, return it.

Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?
