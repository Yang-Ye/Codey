Given a binary tree
<pre>
    struct TreeLinkNode {
      TreeLinkNode *left;
      TreeLinkNode *right;
      TreeLinkNode *next;
    }
</pre>
</p>

<p>Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>Initially, all next pointers are set to <code>NULL</code>.</p>

<p>
<b>Note:</b>
<ul>
<li>You may only use constant extra space.</li>
<li>You may assume that it is a perfect binary tree (ie, all leaves are at the same level, and every parent has two children).</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
For example,<br />
Given the following perfect binary tree,<br />
<pre>
         1
       /  \
      2    3
     / \  / \
    4  5  6  7
</pre>
</p>
<p>
After calling your function, the tree should look like:<br />
<pre>
         1 -> NULL
       /  \
      2 -> 3 -> NULL
     / \  / \
    4->5->6->7 -> NULL
</pre>
</p></p>
