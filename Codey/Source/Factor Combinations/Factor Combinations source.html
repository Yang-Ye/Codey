<p>Numbers can be regarded as product of its factors. For example,</p>
<pre>
8 = 2 x 2 x 2;
  = 2 x 4.
</pre>
<p>Write a function that takes an integer n and return all possible combinations of its factors.</p>
<p>Note:<br/>
You may assume that n is always positive.<br/>
Factors should be greater than 1 and less than n.</p>
