<p>Design a Snake game that is played on a device with screen size = width x height. Play the game online if you are not familiar with the game.</p>
<p>The snake is initially positioned at the top left corner (0,0) with length = 1 unit.</p>
<p>You are given a list of food's positions in row-column order. When a snake eats the food, its length and the game's score both increase by 1.</p>
<p>Each food appears one by one on the screen. For example, the second food will not appear until the first food was eaten by the snake.</p>
<p>When a food does appear on the screen, it is guaranteed that it will not appear on a block occupied by the snake.</p>
