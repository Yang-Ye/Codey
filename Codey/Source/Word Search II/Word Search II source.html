<p><p>
Given a 2D board and a list of words from the dictionary, find all words in the board.

For example,<br />
Given <b>words</b> = <code>["oath","pea","eat","rain"]</code> and <b>board</b> = 
<pre>
[
  ['<span style="color:#d70">o</span>','<span style="color:#d70">a</span>','a','n'],
  ['e','<span style="color:#d30">t</span>','<span style="color:#d00">a</span>','<span style="color:#d00">e</span>'],
  ['i','<span style="color:#d70">h</span>','k','r'],
  ['i','f','l','v']
]
</pre>

Return <code>["eat","oath"]</code>.
