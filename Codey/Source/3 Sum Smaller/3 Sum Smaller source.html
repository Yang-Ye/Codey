<p>Given an array of n integers nums and a target, find the number of index triplets i, j, k with 0 &lt;= i &lt; j &lt; k &lt; n that satisfy the condition nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] &lt; target.</p>
<p>For example, given nums = [-2, 0, 1, 3], and target = 2.</p>
<p>Return 2. Because there are two triplets which sums are less than 2:</p>
<pre><code>[-2, 0, 1]
[-2, 0, 3]
</code></pre>
<p>Follow up: Could you solve it in O(n2) runtime?</p>
