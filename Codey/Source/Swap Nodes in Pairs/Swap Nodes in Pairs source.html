 <p><p>
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head.
</p>

<p>
For example,<br />
Given <code>1->2->3->4</code>, you should return the list as <code>2->1->4->3</code>.
</p>

<p>
Your algorithm should use only constant space. You may <b>not</b> modify the values in the list, only nodes itself can be changed.
